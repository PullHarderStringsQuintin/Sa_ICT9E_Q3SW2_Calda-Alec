   		<td>Pablo Honey contains Radiohead's most popular song, creep, which absolutely blasted them into stardom in the alternative and art rock scenes. The album explores themes of nihilism and existental hopelessnes, which was a new concept in the rock scene. However I believe that the rest of the content of the album lacked the visionary sound of Creep, where the signature sound of Radiohead was merely in it's infantile state, it would leave the ears of it's listener much to be desired.</td>

   		<td>Bouncing off the critical acclaim of their second album, The Bends, Radiohead would craft one of the greatest albums music has ever heard. It would explore the air of uselessness within the digital era, and would expand on Thom Yorke's lyrical genius with more abstract lyrics. It would be the pinnacle of Radiohead's "signature sound" and would grant them the acclaim of the world, including me. The album has a mix of beautiful, yet haunting melodies (lucky, exit music), depressing, yet comforting beauty (No surprises, Karma Police) and absolute technicality unheard of in alternate rock at that time (Paranoid Android, Electroneering)
   		Truly it was one of the greatest moments in musical history.</td>

   		<td>Radiohead's big turn around released in 2000.</td>
   		<td>Radiohead, Nigel Goodrich</td>
   		<td>Riding off of the critical praise off Ok Computer, Radiohead would take a complete 180 in terms of their sound. What was considered signature to them, the scraunchy but elegant guitar, the instrumentation which lasted an impact on the listener, and even the very essence of rock music was stripped in their 4th Album, Kid A.
   		It was met with mixed reviews at the time, but would receive unanimous praise upon the flow of time, and would join Ok Computer in the hall of musical greatness.
   	It employs aspects of Electronic, Orhcestra and Ambient music, yet the "signature sound" of Radiohead still remained, and would stay true to it despite all of it's differences.</td>
